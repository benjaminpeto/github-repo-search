# Take-Home challenge

The app was made with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. Following the brief requirements, the first section contains a responsive slideshow with responsive and optimised images for web use.
The second section has a form element with an input where you are able to search Github users for their repositories. These are displayed on screen and provides access to the URL of each repository.
In case of a non existant user, or a non existant public repository, an error message will be displayed on the page.

### To be able to run this project on your local machine, you will need to proceed the following steps:

    1. Make a Pull Request
    2. Open Terminal and run the following scripts
    3. `cd ./into/the/path/to/the/directory/where/it/was/saved`
    4. `live-server`

This will immediately run the app on port :8080 on your local machine.
